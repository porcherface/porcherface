# ðŸ”­ Now on

blockchain! i'm currently very passionate about solidity smart contracts and dapps. i've started two small projects on the ethereum blockchain, go chek them if you are a solidity enjoyer too:

  https://github.com/porcherface/conec-for : a connect4 implementation on the ethereum blockchain
  https://github.com/porcherface/attr-act  : a NFT factory on the butterfly effect

something about these numbers: 

- C is my first language. i've used it extensively both in university and in my jobs, for more than 10 years. nonetheless most of the code present in this language card comes from a single 6 months session in 42, Rome. 

- Python is the one I feel most versatile with. I've ranged from neural networks to pygames, used to make small animations, guis, blockchain frontends, 3d printer controllers and a lot of small projects. 

- Solidity is my current focus, there's still not much but it's ranking fast.

- C++ comes from arduino projects developed for an escape room in Rome (go check them out, they are super cool: [Cogito Ergo Room](https://cogitoergoroom.it/)

- Tex contributions come only from a single set of sources from my graduation thesis on spin glasses.
